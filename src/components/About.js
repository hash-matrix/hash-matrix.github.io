        <h2>For the Backbone of Bharat's Growth</h2>
        <p>
          India's industrial growth depends on skilled professionals who build, maintain, and innovate across critical sectors. From massive infrastructure projects that connect cities to precision manufacturing on factory floors, RIVET bridges the gap between India's talented Civil, Mechanical, Electrical workforce and the opportunities that drive our nation forward.

        <p>
          We understand that finding the right talent shouldn't be complicated by layers of middlemen and lengthy processes. That's why RIVET creates direct connections between skilled professionals and employers, ensuring faster hiring, better matches, and sustainable career growth for India's core engineering community.
